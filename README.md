# BERT_ChineseWordSegment

Supporting code for the paper "Domain Adaptation of Transformers for English Word Segmentation".

This is a only slightly modified version of the original repository to work with Western languages.

In order to reproduce our results, please utilize the BERT-Mini model made available at [googleresearch/bert](https://github.com/google-research/bert) instead of BERT-Base Chinese.

For more information about this project, please refer to the [original README](https://github.com/jiangpinglei/BERT_ChineseWordSegment).
